# Summary

The objective of this project is to create a solar powered, HomeKit connected outdoor fence door monitoring device. Once setup, the doorâ€™s state (i.e. open/close) can be monitored and used in automations within the HomeKit ecosystem. Data is also sent to [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/).
